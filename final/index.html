                <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                <p class="par">
                    If you want to be successful when working out you need to decide what your goals are. Do you want to
                    run
                    a marathon? Be the strongest guy/girl at your gym? Or just have have a nice beach bod? This choice
                    is going to
                    affect how much you workout, the instensity, and how much weight you're lifting. Once you have your
                    goal in mind,
                    figure which of these training schemes it aligns with:
                    <li>Strength: maximize the strength of your muscles</li>
                    <li>Power: maximize explosive strength.</li>
                    <li>Hypertrophy: build muscle mass</li>
                    <li>Endurance: increase the amount of time you can use your muscles</li>
                </p>

                <h2>Choosing Exercises</h2>
                <p class="par2">
                    When choosing exercises to incorporate into your workout plan you want to choose ones that will be
                    specific to the
                    activities that you want to do. Lets say for example you are a soccer goalie, what kind of training
                    do you want to
                    focus on? Goalies rely on agility, strength, and power to stop and 80 mph ball from going into an
                    8x24 foot box. They
                    need to have powerful legs to be able to thrust themselves in front of the ball. Knowing this it
                    would be much more beneficial
                    for a goalie to do exercises like box jumps, jump squats, and medicine ball throws, rather than have
                    the run 400m intervals.
                    Many exercises can apply to many different activities/sports so just keep this in mind as you make
                    your plan

                <h2>Why Should you Workout?</h2>
                <p class="par3">
                    If you want to feel happy and healthy there's no better medicine then hitting the gym. Incorporating
                    resistance
                    training into your life has numerous benefits. Working out in the gym and doing some cardio can help
                    manage your weight,
                    improve your mood, and prevent health conditions and diseases.

                <h2>Frequency</h2>
                <p class="par3">
                    How often you workout is also contingent on what your goals are. If you want to compete in strong
                    man competitions you
                    better be in the gym everyday. But if you just want to be able to keep up with your friends when
                    your on a hike 2-3 times
                    a week would be enough for you. It also depends on your skill level. If you're a beginner and you're
                    just starting out
                    you should workout 2-3 times week. If you've done training before and you want to start up again,
                    3-4 times a week
                    If you're more advanced, you know all the machines and the person at the desk of the gym knows your
                    name, 4 or more times
                    per week. These guidelines can still vary though, and are just general recomendations.
