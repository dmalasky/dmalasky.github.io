    rn im thinking checkboxes with exercises listed by muscle. like a shopping page ( will need a filter)
    ex. select triceps, chest, and shoulders and only show workouts that focus on those muscles. then allow the user to select a couple.

    it seems easiest right now to have them build one workout at a time, ie one day. 

    some form boxes: muscles worked, day of workout, type of workout

    i would like for type of workout to print the selected workouts with the recomended sets and reps chosen for them or if thats to hard add 
    a note next to the sets and reps form box "Refer to the workout type page" or just add the chart for reference.
